<p>We are happy to annouce the release of our first open source software, <a href="https://github.com/MonsantoCo/stoop">Stoop</a>. Based on an existing <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/CouchDB">Haskell library</a>, Stoop is a Scala DSL for interfacing with CouchDB. Implementation can be easily switched between talking to an actual Couch or a fake (mock) one for testing. Weâ€™ve released this under the Modified BSD License, so check it out and let us know if you have any questions, if you find bugs, or even if you have a <a href="https://github.com/MonsantoCo/stoop/pulls">pull request</a> to fix something!</p>
